      "q1": "What is a Partner? How is it different from traditional agents?",
      "a1": "Partners are brand co-builders, not traditional tiered agents. We have no inventory requirements, all earnings come from real end-product sales. Every box you share ships directly from the factory, ensuring quality and freshness.",
      "q2": "Can investing RM1000 really earn more than RM2000?",
      "a2": "Yes! Invest RM1000 to become a Launch Partner and receive 2000 LY Points. This means you can withdraw minimum RM2000 (1:1 LY deduction). But earnings go far beyond 2x—through your 10-tier referral network, every sale replenishes your LY Points proportionally, continuously unlocking more earnings!",
      "q3": "What's the difference between cashback dividends and RWA pool dividends?",
      "a3": "Cashback dividends are instant cashback from your direct sales or 3-generation network sales (50%/30%/20%). RWA pool dividends are periodic dividends every 10 days—the platform puts 30% of sales into the bonus pool, distributed by your RWA token ratio. Both require equal LY Points for withdrawal.",
      "q4": "What are LY Points? How to replenish?",
      "a4": "LY Points are your earnings security deposit. Every sale in your 10-tier referral network replenishes LY Points by tier percentage (Tier 1: 8%, Tier 2: 5%...). As long as your network stays active, LY Points flow continuously, and earnings naturally keep coming!",
      "q5": "Why does withdrawal require LY Points deduction?",

      "p2": "However, truly high-quality, preservative-free fresh-stewed fish maw and bird's nest products were rare in the market. This is the healthiest way to nourish, yet very time-consuming to prepare. Urban women often busy caring for family and work simply couldn't make a proper bowl for themselves.",
